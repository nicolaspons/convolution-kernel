# convolution-kernel
Convolution kernel for image processing. It can be used for blurring, sharpening, embossing, edge detection, and more. This is accomplished by doing a convolution between a kernel and an image.

To use it:
	- $ python main.py
		help
	- $ python main.py 'imgsrc' 'kernel'
		with kernel: 	sharpen
				edgedetection1
				edgedetection2
				edgedetection3
				boxblur
				gaussianblur
